  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 5, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>ER Time</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") provides a healthcare utility app designed to help users locate nearby emergency rooms, view estimated wait times, and access directions. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal identifiers like your name, email address, or contact details. However, we may access the following types of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data (Precise):</strong> We use your device’s precise location to help you find nearby emergency rooms and display directions on the map. This location is used temporarily and is not stored or shared.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>The data we access is used exclusively for the following purpose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide location-based results (e.g., hospitals near you).</li>
    <li>To display routing and mapping features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your location or any other user data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We process your location data ephemerally — it is used in real-time to provide app features and is not retained or stored after use.</p>

  <h2>5. Account Information</h2>
  <p>No account is required to use this app. We do not collect usernames, passwords, or other identifiers.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>All data is transmitted securely using encryption in transit. We follow best practices to protect your information.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>As no data is retained, there is no stored information to access, correct, or delete.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.</p>
